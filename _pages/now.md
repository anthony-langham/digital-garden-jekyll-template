# 🎯 now

What I'm doing now

_Location:_ Manchester, UK

- I'm the Medical Director at [`suvera`](https://www.suvera.org.uk) a digital health company that enables proactive care for patients living with long term conditions.

- I also work as a General Practitioner in the National Health Service in the United Kingdom.

- My daughter is 2 years old and enjoys telling me what to do at the moment!

- I have been experimenting in learning to code, such as creating this site. Please see the [[colophon]] for more information on how this created.

- You can find me on [`linkedin`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dranthonylangham/) or occasionally on [`twitter`](https://twitter.com/anthonylangham) and even more rarely on [`github`](https://github.com/anthony-langham)
