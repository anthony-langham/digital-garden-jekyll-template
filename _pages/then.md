# then ‚èÆ

Prior to [[now]] this is what i've done

- I've been a hobbyist coder since childhood, often spending hours with my brother building computer games on our BBC micro
- I have been a practising medical doctor since 2007. I've worked in a variety of fields within medicine, including psychiatry, emergency medicine, general surgery, general medicine, infectious diseases and palliative care.
- I worked in Australia as an Resident Medical Officer in Lismore, NSW. I completed rotations in Emergency medicine, Paediatrics and General Medicine.
- I completed by post graduate training in general practice (primary care) in the UK in 2015 and have been working in this field since that time. I find general practice to be the most rewarding and interesting of the medical specialities i have worked in.
- In 2016 I joined a healthtech company called [babylon health](www.babylonhealth.com). At babylon I managed a large team of doctors and epidemiologists. I co-designed and implemented babylon's post-market surveillance framework. I collaborated with multiple stakeholders including Product, Data Scientists, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineers to create world class AI healthcare solutions.
- I returned to work in Australia as a General Practioner where I was delivering healthcare to people in Lismore NSW.
