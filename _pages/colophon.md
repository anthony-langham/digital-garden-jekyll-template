# colophon

This site is built using [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/), [`Obsidian`](https://obsidian.md/), [`Github`](https://www.github.com), and [`Netlify`](https://www.netlify.com/)

I used Maxime Vaillancourt's free, open source template [`available on GitHub here`](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). Thank you Maxime!

It's hosted on [`netlify`](https://www.netlify.com/) as Github pages aren't able to display the note [`graph`](/graph).

If you want to emulate this site the best way to get started is to read Maxime's [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

If you've been exploring digital gardens and are looking for a good lightweight text editor for writing in markdown. I strongly recommend trying [`Obsidian`](https://obsidian.md/) which is free to use (although some features like syncing across multiple devices requires a subscription).

I followed Mike Tannenbaum's article on [`The Refined Mind`](https://refinedmind.co/) on how to link [`Obsidian to Jekyll`](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow). Thanks to Mike as well!

If you want to look at some more documentation produced by Maxime regarding this template then please check out [[how to use this template]]
