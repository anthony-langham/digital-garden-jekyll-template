title: Agile Governance
---

At Suvera we’re building a more effective, but still informal, structure around governance and safety. People of any experience, function or seniority are able to raise ideas, concerns and expectations - regularly and proactively.

I say we have an informal structure instead of flat one, it’s because I’m of the firm belief that organisations, and people, need a degree of structure to perform at their best. They want accountable leaders and managers - despite what you might have read in wired.

It’s a common startup paradox to self identify as a ‘flat structure’ when it suits (avoiding governance, process and due diligence) but keeping a firmly entrenched hierarchy in place (just without the accountability).

That’s part of the reason that I truly believe that Suvera is the most promising healthtech startup in Europe right now. We’re building a diverse and empathetic healthcare business from the ground up.
