title: what is a digital garden?
---

Welcome to my digital garden! This is where I explore my ideas and share them publicly so others can read and provide feedback to help me [[improve my thinking]].

a digital garden is a non linear personal website that doesn't follow the conventional rules of blogging or SEO. I came across this concept for the first time recently and wanted to convert some of my earlier writing into this format.
