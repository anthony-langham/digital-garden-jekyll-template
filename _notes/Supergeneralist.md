## T-shaped people

You’ve probably heard about ‘T -shaped’ people before.

The theory goes that it’s advantageous for businesses to hire people who have a single area of deep knowledge, and who are also able to collaborate empathetically with different teams within a company.

The top part of the ‘T’ implies empathy and the ability to collaborate, and the downward part is the person’s deep domain knowledge.

It’s not entirely clear who first developed the concept and coined the phrase ‘T shaped’ people.

According to McKinsey they were using the term internally from the 1980s onwards. Whilst this is entirely feasible it’s a pity they didn’t show their work 😉

Apparently, the first public use of the concept was by David Guest in 1991 who wrote a piece in the Independent called "The hunt is on for the Renaissance Man of computing”. Although I can’t actually find this article online.

It was definitely Tim Brown at IDEO who brought the concept into the mainstream in the early 2000s.

Regardless of who we decide to credit, this metaphor is somewhere between 30 and 40 years old.

Being this old isn’t *inherently* bad (I’m the same age 😩), but it *is* out of date, and here’s why:

Technology, Society, (and more recently - Office work) have all been **_completely_** transformed since the 1980s.

But it’s the changes in technology that are most important when considering cross-functional teams. The main changes are:

1.  Increasing access and speed of the internet.
2.  Computer processing power doubling every other year ( [Moore’s law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law))
3.  Smart phone technology

## Low code / No code

We’re at a point in time (2021) that there are so many SaaS companies and Low code / No code solutions to technical problems, that someone with the correct aptitude and drive can become highly proficient in multiple functions within a business.

If they have access to the internet, **anyone** can learn **anything** from **anywhere** on earth. All they need is the cognitive capacity and the desire to learn. 🥳

## Ok, so what’s a supergeneralist then?

The term ‘supergeneralist’ originates from ecology.

Certain species of plants and animals are able to interact with many more species, in many more environments than scientists would normally expect.

Supergeneralists differ from generalists, who are able to survive in a wide range of environments, but are limited in their capacity to interact with other species.

They also differ from specialists, who are extremely well suited to a particular environment, but again also only interact with a small number of other species.

Supergeneralists are able to survive in a wide range of environments **and** interact with lots and lots of different species.

## Why does this matter?

Transposing the supergeneralist concept from ecology - into startups, is a more relevant way of thinking about cross-functional people.

We’re at a point where there are lots of cross-functional people who are not adequately represented by the ‘T shaped’ concept and are actually functioning at deeper levels across multiple business functions.

The image below is a representation of broad collaborative qualities _and_ multiple areas of deep domain knowledge.

I’ve been lucky to meet and work with many supergeneralists over the years; doctors who are entrepreneurs, visual designers who code and build hardware. Data scientists who are also product managers.

These people simply don’t fit into the ‘T-shaped’ model. They’re supergeneralists, and they’re supercharged by technology.
