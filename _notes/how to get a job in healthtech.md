title: How to get a Job in Healthtech
---

### Be honest

#### Be honest about your knowledge:

You don’t know everything about medicine, no-one does, not even the most prestigious professor or the longest working GP in the world.

#### Be honest about your reasons for wanting to work in healthtech:

did you see the social network and think that you could be the next zuckerberg or that the parties look great? I'd advise against that type of thinking, sure the perks are much better than working in the public sector, but its not hollywood.

### Be humble

Working in a healthtech startup will expose you to a lot of people who are as clever, if not much more intelligent than you are. Which can be a nasty suprise for some doctors! If you don’t know the answer to a question, say so, and make a plan to loop back around with the answers.

### Find common ground.

You need to be as close to a [[Supergeneralist|Supergeneralist]] as you can. Learn the acronyms. Read around the topics, look for similarities in workflows.

### Find your unique superpowers.

### Be flexible.

### Be accountable.

If your joining a healthtech company as a doctor you're probably there to add medical knowledge (there's always exceptions obviously). Being accountable means keeping up to date with latest research which could affect the care the company is providing. It also means ensuring that you bring your years of training and experience to the company for a positive impact on patients lives.

### Use your network

Cringe right? Its so true though. A personal recommendation goes a long way to getting a job in healthtech, as it does in any other business. This doesn't mean you'll get a job this way, but it increases the chances you'll be considered when an opportunity arises.

### Hustle.

Will Gao gave a talk recently on how you’ve got to have some hustle to get ahead. Fair play. Our first intern - Zakee Abdi heard that talk and acted on it. Props.

### Start Early.

University is the best time to network and found a company

### Start Late.

If you’re reading this and you’re retired, almost retired and anywhere in between in your clinical career, let me say you’re valuable. Very valuable. You’ve got real world experience. If you can think in an ‘objective’ manner and explain to someone who’s never had to rewrite a drug chart, why you’re justifiably confident to ignore that pop up in Emis web that tells you to do something that doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.

### Just start.
