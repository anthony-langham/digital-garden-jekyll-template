title: "about me"
---

Iâ€™m an NHS GP in Manchester, with an interest in menâ€™s health and mental health.Â 

Iâ€™m also the Clinical Lead atÂ [Suvera](https://www.suvera.co.uk/)

Weâ€™re a small but mighty team ðŸ’ªbuilding the most comprehensive virtual care for long term conditions.

I graduated medical school in 2007, achieved MRCGP in 2015, and Iâ€™ve been working as a GP since then.

I was previously the Clinical AI Lead atÂ [babylon health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/)Â (employee #52) where I built and managed a team of clinicians.Â 

I designed and implemented the clinical systems and services that underpinned the companyâ€™s cutting edge AI products.

Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with many supergeneralists over the past few years - doctors who are also entrepreneurs, designers who also code, data scientists who also manage products, to name a few examples.

As well as writing about the topics Iâ€™m interested in, Iâ€™ll be unpacking what is a supergeneralist and talking to them to learn how they developed broadÂ **and**Â deep cross-functional skills.
