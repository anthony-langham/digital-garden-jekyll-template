Thereâ€™s a common misconception in Britain that GPs are inept or unreasonably skeptical about technology.

Newsflash: Iâ€™ve never met a GP who wears a cardigan or plays golf during work hours

Moreover, I'll set out my argument that British GPs are actually the earliest adopters of healthtech in the world.Â ðŸ™‚

## The origin of the EHR

Do you know when & where the first primary care electronic health record (EHR) in the world was launched?

No, it wasn't Cupertino or even Manhattan. It was actuallyÂ [Whipton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Whipton,+Exeter/@50.73253,-3.561128,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x486da3929c248e0f:0x2610f441d55e5812!8m2!3d50.7327208!4d-3.4910172)Â near Exeter when Dr John Preece became the first GP in the world to use a computer during a consultation.

Even more incredible is that this first occurred inÂ **1970.**Â Yep that was the year that Simon and Garfunkle were in the charts and the M*A*S*H movie was released.

Dr Preece continued to research new uses for computers in medicine, co-designing a widely used drug database. He also wrote a book titledÂ ["The Use of Computers in General Practice"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Use-Computers-General-Practice-1e-dp-044306394X/dp/044306394X/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)Â 

Just to repeat this point, Dr Preece was using an EHRÂ _**50 years**_Â ago.

The last time I checked the majority of NHS hospitals areÂ **still**Â using pen and paper on wards and in out-patient departments.

[NB. Iâ€™m happy to be corrected on this one ðŸ™ƒ]

## Pandemic + Healthtech

When COVID-19 struck the UK in the first quarter of 2020, Primary Care doctors were quick to adopt a telemedicine first approach - as per NHSE guidelines, because we were concerned about vulnerable patients being exposed to COVID in the waiting room.Â 

Donâ€™t believe the negative press about GPs from the likes of the Times and The Daily Mail - NHS general practice was open throughout, we were working, we were providing care to those who needed it - home visits for palliative care patients or elderly patients struggling and isolated.Â 

We may not have had the front door unlocked, but you should probably have been staying at home anyway.

In addition to face-to-face appointments that wereÂ **clinically**Â indicated, we called, texted, emailed, instant messaged and even video called our patients.

This digital transformation was a long time in the making, but we essentially adopted this new way of working overnight and continued to provide high-quality holistic care for our patients.Â I worked throughout 2020 and through the pandemic, and let me tell you - it was brutal.Â 

As a clinician with an interest in digital transformation, I was especially proud of my fellow general practitioners and their 'early majorityâ€™ status in terms of adoption of digital health tools and services. We werenâ€™t early adopters like the folks at babylon or push doctor.

But we were certainly way ahead of the pack within the NHS, so much so that Iâ€™m sure Dr. Preece would have been proud of us as a profession.
