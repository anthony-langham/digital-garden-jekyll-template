title: how to share medical knowledge with a start up
---

If you’re a medical expert, medical Director or are fulfilling a similar function in a healthtech startup you’re definitely going to have to come up with an answer to this question

In truth, much like most answers in medicine, the answer can be summarised as ‘it depends’

It depends on the size of the startup, the complexity or breadth of the subject matter, the depth that your company is providing vs the width of conditions

At Suvera I’m trying to provide a range of different levels of medical information to different members of the broader team [[MDTTs]]

I approach this as I would in my surgery. Try to assess what people want to know. Start simple, check and chunk, increase complexity as requested, try to avoid over complicating diseases or concepts.
